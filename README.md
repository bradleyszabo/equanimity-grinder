# Club Description

There are no shortage of problems faced by humanity. We are all privileged to be living in the most peaceful and prosperous time in human history, but we are far from the equanimous paradise we seek. Pain, suffering, trauma, and plight still surge for many. This club is dedicated to bringing together the cross-functional minds and talents on the [Clubhouse platform](https://joinclubhouse.com) to dissect problems and put forth proposed solutions forged by critical analysis and rigorous, yet civil discourse. The proposed solutions are intended to be open-source - available for fair advancement and implementation with a singular goal - improve lives.

# Goal

Develop solution proposals for problems faced in this world, offering them as open-source to be implemented.

# Rules

Maintain composure. Seek equanimity. Contribute positive and critical thoughts, constructively.
Assume positive intent. We seek to cultivate and tolerate only one heightened emotion - excitement in the flow of ideas to improve humanity - one problem at a time.

# Title Explanation

Originally I named the club 'Problems Grinder', but Equanimity quickly became a key theme as I began writing the club description. All attendees will need to seek equanimity, and the process will grind and cause failure to that end, so I chose to change it to 'Equanimity Grinder'.
