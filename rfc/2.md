# Request for Comments (RFC) 2
# Blockchain Axiom Graphs (BAGs)

Longstanding idea coaleseced with this name during a great discussion on duffy.org Clubhouse room
5/2/2021 with [@gduffy](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@gduffy) and
[@shaunmartin](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@shaunmartin), and several other brilliant minds.

Utilize the cryptographically traceable accounting ledger known as blockchain to build easily navigable and consumable
knowledge sets (a.k.a.axiom sets or bags) to provide a common data set to use in educational channels and in
intelligent discourse and debate. Common foundation of ideas.

Each entry must be as simple as possible - a boolean statement.

Some options for fun constraints... Haikus

Haikus are beautiful and fun because the ideas must be delivered within 5 syllable or 7 syllable statements,
and can be interchanged to create new variations.

Each statement must be a boolean haiku phrase (5 or 7 syllables) resulting in true or false.

The directed acyclic graph will actually produce fully formed haikus.

Consider a future on human discourse platforms like Clubhouse...
"Here are my bags. I have started at origin, and here is where I stand - my current pointer set."

No bag is absolutely correct. Unless all minds finally agree.

This can also be a game. Participants work to refine and reduce BAGs to be the most concise, most dense
graphs - all signal, zero noise.

Human1: "How did you come to this viewpoint or conclusion?"\
Human2: "Here is my bag pointer for that concept. Where do you disagree with my path?"
