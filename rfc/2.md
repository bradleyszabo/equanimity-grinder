# Request for Comments (RFC) 2
# Blockchain Axiom Graphs (BAGs)

Longstanding idea coalesced with this name during a great discussion on duffy.org Clubhouse room
5/2/2021 with [Greg Duffy](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@gduffy) and
[Dr. Shaun Martin](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@shaunmartin), [John Martin](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@johndavidfive),
[Dr. Stacy Duffy](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@stacyduffy)
and several other brilliant minds.

Utilize the cryptographically traceable accounting ledger known as blockchain, as well as the related distributed
version control concepts, to build easily navigable and consumable knowledge sets (a.k.a.axiom sets or bags) to provide
a common data set to use in educational channels and in intelligent discourse and debate. Common foundation of ideas.

Each entry must be as simple as possible - a boolean statement.

Some options for fun constraints... Haikus

Haikus are beautiful and fun because the ideas must be delivered within 5 syllable or 7 syllable statements,
and can be interchanged to create new variations.

Each statement must be a boolean haiku phrase (5 or 7 syllables) resulting in true or false.

The directed acyclic graph will actually produce fully formed haikus.

Consider a future on human discourse platforms like Clubhouse...
"Here are my bags. I have started at origin, and here is where I stand - my current pointer set."

No bag is absolutely correct. Unless all minds finally agree.

Every node in each bag can either stand alone, or also link to external resources and additional context.

This can also be a game. Participants work to refine and reduce BAGs to be the most concise, most dense
graphs - all signal, zero noise.

Human1: "How did you come to this viewpoint or conclusion?"\
Human2: "Here is my bag pointer for that concept. Where do you disagree with my path?"

Blockchain is used here somewhat tongue in cheek. It is a buzzword technology. It may be useful or applicable for BAGs
that have widespread consensus - i.e recording truly foundational knowledge graphs, but it is not required for this concept to succeed.

The concepts of distributed version control, specifically [git](https://git-scm.com/), developed by the brilliant technology contributor to
humanity, [Linus Torvalds](https://github.com/torvalds), which can be used to build and collaborate with BAGs.

My good friend [John Martin](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@johndavidfive) has done work to visualize knowledge graphs
using browser rendering technology - [WebGL](https://get.webgl.org/). We all learn best through engaging multiple learning modalities and
senses. Visualize walking an island of ideas and deriving your own path, absorbing key concepts on the journey.
Meet in a virtual room using VR/AR (a Clubhouse future feature?) to discuss the current leaf node in question, and
forge ahead. 

## Concept History
I developed this general concept back during my first "manic" episode (psychosis) in 2017.
I audaciously called one of my most esteemed academic mentors - a computer science professor at Arizona State University
and told him I wanted to get a PhD by developing a new method for conferring PhDs, using this technique. How do we
confer PhDs currently? We train people on existing concepts and beliefs in a field, and then the person must contribute
new ideas (original art) which are accepted by the current field of peer experts. Why not streamline this using the BAG concept? The PhD thesis simply becomes a new node in the
knowledge graph. Concisely described as a boolean statement with as many
relationships identified. Defended and expanded upon with linked context writings.

The concept was summarily dismissed. There is a protocol. Of course. I herein propose a new path. Literally
[redux | part deux](https://equanimitygrinder.club/rfc/2).

Thought? Fork and respond. [Pitter patter, let's get at 'er](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpMlJacfeA0)
